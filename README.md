Tournament site for your needs! :^)
Can be used for siege, rocket leauge and many more!
## Summary 
The primary goal with ggHUB for me is to learn, I have worked in Rails before but I want to become more comfortable using Rails. My second goal was to create something that actully could be used. And the last but not least was to create a project for my portfolio.

## Run it locally
1. Make sure you have Ruby installed, you can check with this command; `ruby -v``
2. Make sure you have the Ruby on Rails gem, otherwise run: `gem install rails``
3. Now you can navigate to the directory and run: `rails s``
4. The site can now be accessed at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) 

If you want to fake users on the site you can run: `rails db:migrate:reset`and then `rails db:seed`.
